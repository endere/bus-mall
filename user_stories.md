As a marketer, I want the code to track amount of times each picture appeared and was clicked so I can gather good product statistics.

As a developer, I want to use proper use of arrays and random number generation, so that there is no higher value placed on any one picture or another.

As a user, I want a crisp, and easy interface so that I can breeze through my selections quickly.

As a marketer, I want the statistics to be well organized and properly displayed so that I can inform my decisions with as much clear information as possible.
