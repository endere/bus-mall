To do, in rough order:

Create an array of objects, each with properties that represent their image URL, the amount of times they were clicked, the amount of times they were selected, and their own numerical ID, for the future use of a random number generator.

Create a system that randomly selects three numbers from an array of all pictures.

Alter the system so it refuses to select the same number twice, or any number used in the last rotation (a seperate array).

Make this system loop 25 times in a for loop.

Have the system place the pictures into the HTML.

Add event listeners to the pictures, so that selections can be made.

Add functionality to the event listeners so that they update the image properties as the program progresses.

Have the program display data in the form of a table once 25 selections have been made.
This table should show times shown, times clicked, % of times clicked when shown, and order all of the items based on popularity.

Use CSS to make it all look nice.
